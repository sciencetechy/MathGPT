# MathGPT - Generate Practice Tests for Mathematics using AI
MathGPT can generate practice questions for specific areas and additionally generate complete practice test papers to prepare confidently for the exams.
This project uses an innovative technique that tries to leverage the mathematics knowledge and capabilities of AI models and also to be aware of their advantages and limitations. 
The technique was demonstrated by developing a software application named MathGPT that uses OpenAI GPT3.5 which is a large language model (LLM). Users of this application are anyone
who wants to practice school level mathematics. MathGPT allows the user to specify their requirements by using an easy-to-use GUI that primarily captures existing questions or existing test papers, 
the desired complexity and the number of practice questions or complete practice papers to generate. Using this input MathGPT generates new questions or new complete practice papers and displays them through the GUI. 
MathGPT has been tested extensively using specific questions from various topics and areas as per elementary school curriculum and also as well on complete test papers. After analyzing the results obtained 
using MathGPT, it is observed that by employing the technique proposed in this project it is possible to exploit the mathematics capabilities of the LLMs and to also overcome its limitations to create an 
innovative and useful application for students all around the globe.
